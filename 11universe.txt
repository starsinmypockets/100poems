100 Poems - 11/99 -- Universe

if the universe is conscious
is it all alone
(and if so from whence
its sense of self)
maybe the universe
is just one of many
each bubble a trap 
for the self
is the sense of self
a prerequisite for
consciousness
(maybe just a side effect)
is the universe right handed
with no Catholics to beat
the bad out of it
maybe it's not Catholic
maybe it's Budhist
which makes sense
as something other to
me that seems cool and 
that I don't understand
maybe things are
so fucked up because
the universe had a 
poor upbringing a 
lack of moral fibre
no father figure
if the universe is 
conscious does it
have terrible anxiety
(so much could go wrong
will it continue 
to expand until it 
pops contract and
finally die and
will it then 
be born again
and given the opportunities
that every universe 
deserves)
