100 Poems - 01/99 -- are cars electric

it's cold outside
with the windows rolled down and the ac on
outside it's raining
but it seems like it should be cold enough
to freeze the breath of the crows ranked 
on the sagging wires like soldiers 
smoking cigarrettes at a funeral

the car is driving itself
and finally I have a chance
to think but there's a knock at the door
and i'm startled because i thought 
we were alone a form of perfect symmettry
that I should have know was impossible
every catastrophe a perfect symphony
the driving down the road of something
that works all on its own

it's cold outside
with the windows rolled down and the ac on
it's raining but it seems to me like
it should be cold enough to freeze
the breath of crows ranked
on the sagging lines like soldiers smoking
cigarettes at a funeral

the car is driving itself
and finally I have a chance
to think but there's a knock at the door
and i'm startled because i thought
we were alone a form of perfect symmetry
that I should have know was impossible
every catastrophe a perfect symphony
the driving down the road of something
that works all on its own
