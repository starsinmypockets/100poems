100 Poems - 12/99 -- perdiendo el control

cigarettes and dust
stacked cinderblock stairs
rewinding a tape with a bick pen
listening to the same song 
over and over and over and over and over
if we left we would die
if we staid we would die
many already have
some will die better
on this side of the line
