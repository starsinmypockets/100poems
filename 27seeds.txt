100 Poems - 27/99 -- seeds

i'll admit that i enjoy it
watching the streets all
overcapped with mud
mud mixed with leaves 
leaves mixed with leaves 
mixed with brief plastic blunt-wrap-wraps
stringy snarls of black plastic bags
poison yes to some but bejeebus look around you
what a growth medium (albeit again for some) god's own
anti-erosion measure: clogs drains! let the rain
chose a longer path to the sea! but the drains, oh!
clogged them with this lush mix, the rest is left with 
nowhere to go watch it pile up and up soon the curb is just a
gentle ramp from sidewalk to street watch the sidewalk crack!
(break a mother's back) the sidewalk block a sad sad thing but not 
to the reeds! the reed sprouts towards the sky a seed a seed waiting 
patient waiting for the day the sidewalk would split and it split it did it 
split it split and now to grow and what will i grow? what will i grow i will grow
seeds not one or two i will grow a million seeds just between friends a million easy
like taking a breath like going to work with a hangover like a plane lifts off with a
thousand onboard simple as a semi- we'll grow a trillion remember the road? remember the
sidewalk? remember the drain? no we don't remember the fucking drain the river remember the
river? the flood plain flows and a trillion seeds in the fall air something shiny (albeit a 
plague for some all the benadryl is lost in the sea the sea let the sea stay where it is even a
foot at the high tide we could handle let it come but jesus just a foot for gods' sake this isn't
fucking new jersey)
