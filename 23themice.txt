100 Poems - 23/99 -- the mice

we put out traps
for the mice at night 
we could hear them
laugh as they danced
around them drinking
eating our food and
drinking our wine

at the hardware they
sold brown pellets
that advertised to
kill the mice we
left them in the 
trash now at night
all we can hear are 
the screams
