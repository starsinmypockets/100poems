100 Poems - 19/99 -- godless

another godless sunrise
many among us still fitful in
the perch of sleep wandering in 
the haze of a summer gone by
or of one yet to come and if
the sun went out would the moon
continue to shine
the answer is no
not even at night

past the land and into the frothy sea
just left of a gray array of rocks
the water rousing drawn somehow
towards another distant rock wading in
the sky pauses briefly thoughtful
maybe frozen there still in the endless
time-stack of yesterdays considering
whether or not to fall and do
violence to whatever lies before it
the same rhythmic violence that
has drowned sailors since sailors
and will surely devour the land as well
just an echo really of a much greater violence 
driving the whole thing along
