100 Poems - 32/99 -- the moon

the moon is so much closer now
the plants reach for it at night
hungry and pale
the day is full of it
cratered gray dirt
rains down on us
coats us all in a
metallic sheen so that
even under the light
of the sun we look
like lost children
clutching at lampposts
for warmth
