100 Poems - 16/99 -- normal

i woke up (covered in blood) today
this is (not) normal
this is just (not) how a person wakes up
(bloody from the night before)
it is (not) how people in magazines wake up
it is (not) how people on television wake up
it is (not) how people in text books wake up
this is of course (not) how people on billboards wake up as well
a doctor would (not) expect a normal person to wake up in this manner
and after waking up you can (not) and should (not) simply go about your day
you can(not) go to work
you can(not) pick up the kids from school
you can(not) wash the floor
you can(not) wash the car
you can(not) in fact do whatever you want and just as you wish
it is (not) normal to just wake up and start your day (covered in blood)
