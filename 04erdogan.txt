I dreamt that Recep Tayyip Erdogan 
was living in a little artists' 
warehouse in North Philly -- the 
kind of place that's set back 
from the street near the water with 
a big concrete lot in front filled 
with giant puppets or welded up 
abandoned cars -- not that this
place was, but just that it was 
that kind of place. What they
had was a picnic table and Erdogan's
wife was sitting at it -- bespectacled
and proper reading a book like a
good educated person -- almost 
looking down her nose at it like
she would perpretrate some sort of
terrible genocidal act against it
if she didn't like the ending.
She greeted me warmly and called
for her husband who came to the big 
double doors of the warehouse --
bespectacled as well -- and smiled
wanly as if he had been sleeping -- 
or reading -- himself. I gave a little
wave -- what the fuck was I doing
talking to Mr. and Mrs. Erdogan in
North Philly -- and excused myself
politely. At home I started 
looking up pictures of them on 
the internet. If it was them, I
decided, then this must be
some sort of "if I could 
go back in time" moment
