100 Poems - 18/99 -- a starling

a starling my darling
is a beautiful thing
enough of them to
black out the sky
the whole wide world
might just be a little 
thing by now what
with the invention of
television as seen on
the price is right
one must show great care
you'll fall right off
not much out there just 
a few parts per million
